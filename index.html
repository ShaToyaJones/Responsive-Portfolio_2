      <p>Hello! I am ShaToya Jones! My professional background consists of Customer Service, Information Technology, and Education. I have a bachelor's degree in Technical Management from DeVry University. I began working on my master's degree in Information Assurance (Cyber Security) at Strayer University in 2016; however, that degree was put on hold as I decided to learn full-stack web development.</p>

      <p>I am a member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated. I've held leadership positions within this organization such as Phylacter, Secretary, and First Vice President. We do a lot of community service such as hosting community wide baby showers, road clean up, feeding the homeless, etc.</p>
